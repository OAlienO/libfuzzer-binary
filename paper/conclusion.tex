\label{sec:conclusion}

We design and implement \sys, a binary fuzzer based on \libfuzzer.
This is a work-in-progress.
Although not all hooks required by \libfuzzer are implemented, our preliminary evaluations show that the current \sys is effectiveness and efficiency.
Our future work is to design and implement all \libfuzzer required hooks and conduct intensive experiments to show its effectiveness.
