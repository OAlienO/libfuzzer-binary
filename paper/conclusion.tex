In this paper we modify LibFuzzer to fuzz ELF executable without source code.
The main work we done is collectng runtime information for LibFuzzer.
Compare to AFL QEMU mode overhead, our result is very similar.
But we still got plenty of hook function we need to implement to make it works exactly like it should be.
