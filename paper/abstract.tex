Libfuzzer is a coverage-guided fuzzing engine.
But not like AFL, which can do the fuzzing without source code, Libfuzzer needs source code of the target to compile and do the fuzzing.
This paper presents a way to use Libfuzzer to fuzz the binary without source code.
Our implementation link the IO of binary with Libfuzzer, and use qemu to collect runtime information.
