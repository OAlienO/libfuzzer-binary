\begin{abstract}
We design and implement \sys, a coverage-guided binary fuzzer based on \libfuzzer.
We discuss how \sys is implemented, measure the overheads of our implementation, and compare its performance against the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer.
This is a work-in-progress.
Our evaluation results show that, compared with the vanilla AFL, the current implementation brings only limited overheads and is able to identify possible vulnerabilities in a shorter time.
